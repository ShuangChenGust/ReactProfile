## Description

Hello, this Shuang Chen. This is my personal protofolio websites, get inspired by Tim baker, an open sources github Repo, also appreciate the documents by Saurabh Mhatre. Although I used an almost well-cooked template, I still researched the logic and revised small parts based on my needs. I used Google Analytics to track the web browser users while used Service Worker function to increate the off-line availability. The whole React framework is clean and easy to use, you can change info in Json file and make some changes with components. Also this project increate my understanding of how to share data between components. 

Difference with origin authors, I used Github pages to deploy my repo. there may have some issues when fetching json data. You can find solutions in my below links. Enjoy!
